## Thanks from ASFG

VOSK api makes offline and free SpeechToText transition handy. It's easy to integrate vosk-api to my project. Great work!

ALSO, all models I use here are a renamed version from vosk-api models. For more details, see [vosk models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models). Thanks again!

## How to use vosk models in ASFG

It's the same as how to use models in [vosk-api](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/). One thing you need to pay attention to is rename the model folder as *model-xxx*, *xxx* is the supported lanaguge abbreviation.

Currently supported languages are:

- chs: Chinese.
- eng: English.
