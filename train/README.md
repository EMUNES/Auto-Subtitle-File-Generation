# How to train our model

## Principles to choose our model

For better usability considering ones without a decent computer to run the inference procedure. This project will be based on single model . Choosing this instead of multi-model embedding also fits the idea of faster processing, as this project is designed to save people"s time.

## Experiments

- The training clip length should be between 2 to 5 seconds. From my experiments, 2s has a serious problem for huge loss while 5s is causing overfitting.
